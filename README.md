# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# ðŸš€ About Me


My name is Daniel, I am a student pursuing a bachelor of science in information technology with a specialization in web development and database management. I am currently looking for an internship in the web development field. My expected graduation date is September 2022.

I am passionate about building websites, and have built several websites during my time as a student. Some of the most notable personal projects  include the Ellensburg parks and recreation website, and the museum of candy website. I am also in the process of learning React.js.

When I am not coding, I enjoy learning new skills. My hobbies range from anime, cooking, running, and video games to some weird ones like underwater basket weaving.
